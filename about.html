        <h3>About This Application</h3>
        <p>
          Champion lookup was created as an entry for the Riot Games champion mastery API challange 2016. It uses a simple algoritem that compares your champion mastery data with others and try recommanding you about champions that you might like and doesn't often play based on that data. <br/>
          This idea comes to keep things frash while playing League and help you extend your champion pool while keeping your playstyle intact! <br/><br/>

        <h4>Making This Project</h4>
        <p>
          Creating this project wasn't easy by any means as it is the first web up I ever created. I've wanted to create a website that League of Legends player all over the world could enjoy. Something new that haven't been done before and what better approtinty I can have then the release of a new API. <br/><br/>
        </p>

        <h4>Project Structure</h4>
        <p>
          For the site design I've used HTML and CSS with the help of bootstrap. <br/>
          The requests to the API server is done using PHP and the logic is done in Javascript with JQuery.<br/><br/>

          You can fiddle around with the code and read the documantation for it here: <br/>
